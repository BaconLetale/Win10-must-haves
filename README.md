# Win10-must-haves
List of programs/tweaks to do after installing Windows. For me to remember or anyone else interested.

# Replacing Windows's built-in features:

## [Listary](https://www.listary.com/)
Listary is a search and file launcher tool. Far better than Microsoft's implementation. It integrates into the file explorer too.

## [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)
Everything is the best Windows tool for searching files. 

## [TeraCopy](https://www.codesector.com/teracopy)
TeraCopy replaces Window's file transfer tool. It's faster, makes errors in transfer pretty much not a thing and if they
do happen, it will notify the user.

## [Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/)
Download manager. Can replace the download prompt in browsers. It's faster, can download files that are too big for a browser's
buffer and allows multiple connections, which can often bypass speed limits on websites.

## [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
A no brainer. Best video player for Windows. Can play pretty much everything.

## [K-Lite Codec pack](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm)
A must have, after installing it, there is pretty much no way of encountering a video file that cannot be played.

## [OOSU10](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10)
Shutup10, great tool for easier management of Window's functionality and for disabling telemetry and annoyances.

## [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)
Best music player on Windows. Extremely customizable with very active community making addons and themes for it.

## [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)
Best screenshot tool. Pretty much makes the Screen Snip obsolete. Can upload files and create links automatically.

## [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html)
One of the best light pdf readers. Very fast.

## [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
Replacement for Notepad. Supports pretty much all commonly and less commonly used languages. Great formatting and integration into the context menu.

## [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
Great terminal tool for various uses, including SSH.

## [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/)
Great addition to the windows defender(or any av). 

## [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)  
Best uTorrent client. Crossplatform.

## [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
Great companion to notepad++. Together any text file can be edited. This is better for large code, but notepad++ has better formatting plugins.

## [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)  
Best file archiver. Supports all common formats, is free and allows for in-archive editing.

## [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)  
No need for description.

## (Needs Microsoft Store!!!) [EarTrumpet](https://github.com/File-New-Project/EarTrumpet)  
Replacement for Win10 sound menu. Adds features removed/moved in one of the earlier updates.
